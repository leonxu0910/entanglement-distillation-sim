# Entanglement Distillation Simulator

Welcome! This is a simulated implementation of the BBPSSW protocol for entanglement distillation in quantum information theory. If all of that sounds pretty scary, go ahead and check out the file ``376A_Final_Post.pdf``, which contains a primer on what our project was about and how to explore our codebase. Also, check out our blog post at https://theinformaticists.com/2019/03/23/exploring-quantum-entanglement-distillation/ for information on how we adapted our project to an outreach for elementary schoolers!
